# Welcome to the show digger!
This project was created as part of an educational one-week assignment from Plataforma 5 coding bootcamp.\
It consists of a movie/ tv show finder that consumes the API from TMDB.\
It currently allows you to create a user (signUp), login, persist login, logout, search for movies, search for series, have a look at the details, add favorites, delete favorites and have a look at the favorites list.\
In the coming weeks I will be improving it and later on I will deploy it.\
In the meantime, you can have a look at the code and run it by entering to your terminal from the backend folder and executing the command "npm i" to install the dependencies and then "npm run devStart" and from the frontend folder executing "npm i" to install the dependencies and then "npm start".\
Hope you enjoy it ðŸ™‚.
